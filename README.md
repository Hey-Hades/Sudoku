## 🧠 How Puzzle Generation Works

This game includes a fully custom-built Sudoku puzzle engine that guarantees **validity** and **uniqueness** for each board.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Solved Board Generation**
   - A full Sudoku board is filled using a backtracking algorithm.
   - The board is randomized but legal, forming a valid solution.

2. **Deep Copy**
   - Before removing values, the solution board is deeply copied to preserve the final answer for:
     - Hint logic
     - Final victory validation

3. **Clue Removal With Uniqueness Guarantee**
   - A list of all cell positions is generated and shuffled.
   - For each cell:
     - Temporarily remove its value.
     - Count total solutions using a solution-counter function.
     - Solution-counter function counts total number of possible solutions of a puzzle.
     - Only remove it permanently if the board still has **exactly one solution**.

4. **Difficulty Control**
   - The engine removes clues based on desired difficulty:
     - Easy: ~35–40 clues
     - Medium: ~28–34 clues
     - Hard: ~22–27 clues
   - However, the engine may **stop early** if further removals break uniqueness — preserving solvability.

### ✅ Guarantees

- Every puzzle has **exactly one valid solution**
- Clue removal is optimized to make the board as challenging as possible without ambiguity

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Made with ❤️ by **Himanshu Sharma**  
Thanks to the many online Sudoku tools and tutorials that inspired the logic design.
Design, highlighting interactions, and several UI features were inspired by [sudoku.com](https://sudoku.com/).
All logic — including board generation, uniqueness validation, hint systems, and animations — was implemented entirely from scratch.
